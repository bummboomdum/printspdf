# Printalbe PDFs

Over time, I create PDF templates to print out that make my day-to-day life easier and help structure my organization a bit. I would like to share 'em with others because that they could help them, too.

## Language
It should come as no surprise that the PDF files are usually written in German.

## PDF
Adobe's Portable desktop files (PDF) can be used, opened, even edited and printed on any computer system without any restrictions.

## Affinity Designer, Affinity Publisher, Affinity Photo 
I primarily use Affinity by Serif software to implement DTP projects, so source files can usually only be edited with these programs.

## License
If you can open, print and edit files, you are free to do so.
